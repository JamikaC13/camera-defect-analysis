# 📸 Camera Defect Analysis  
*A multi-phase manufacturing quality analysis using Pareto charts, root-cause analysis, a fishbone diagram, and statistical methods to investigate rising welding and assembly defects.*

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project analyzes a rise in welding and assembly defects within the Manual Finish welding area of an electronics manufacturing process. Using defect data, Power BI visualizations, and structured problem-solving techniques, the analysis identifies which models and defect types contribute most to IPC-A-610E quality failures.

The project is divided into multiple phases:

- **Phase 1:** Exploratory analysis, Pareto charts, and root-cause (fishbone) analysis  
- **Phase 2:** ANOVA & hypothesis testing (coming soon)  
- **Phase 3:** Recommendations & process improvement plan (future)

## 🎯 Business Problem

The company is experiencing:

- Increased **demand**, and  
- A simultaneous **spike in welding and assembly defects**

Defects such as:

- Solder bridges  
- Missing components  
- Component misalignment  
- Incorrect assembly  
- Excessive or insufficient solder  

are causing boards to fail IPC-A-610E quality standards. Rework after assembly is costly and disrupts production capacity.

📌 **Goal:**  
- Reduce welding defects by **20%**  
- Increase line capacity by **20%** without increasing defect rates

## 📘 Phase 1 – Exploratory Analysis  
**🔗 Link:** [Phase 1 Summary](./phase1/README-Phase1.md)

Phase 1 includes:

- Identification of top defective board models  
- Pareto analysis showing the models responsible for ~80% of all defects  
- Categorization of assembly vs. solder-related issues  
- Root-cause (Fishbone) analysis across: People, Method, Machine, Material, Measurement  
- Key insights used to guide deeper statistical testing in Phase 2
